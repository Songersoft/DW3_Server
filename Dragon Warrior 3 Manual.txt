How to Enjoy Dragon Warrior III

*Read Section I of this Explorer's Handbook, but DO NOT read Section II
at first. You may want to refer to Section II for maps of caves,
towers, and castles, but you won't enjoy the game as much if you depend
too much on the information provided in Section II.

*Section I explains the commands and the features of Dragon Warrior
III. With the information about spells and items on the Dragon Warrior
III Map Poster, you should be able to start your quest. By gathering
information from people (or animals!) in the game, you should learn how
to proceed.

*If you get stuck and can't figure out what to do, try remembering what
you have heard and seen. Chances are there was a clue which will put
you back on track.

*If you give up figuring outhow to proceed, refer to Section II for
hints.

*Use the clues in the Ultimate Hint section only as a last resort.

*Save your game periodically, especially before venturing into new
territories or attempting things you are unsure about.

                 Important-SAVING THE GAME-Important
You can save your game by visiting any one of the Kings and/or other
characters who have access to the Imperial Scrolls of Honor. When you
wish to rest from the game after saving, remember to hold the RESET
Button in while turning off the POWER. Otherwise, you may damage the
valuable saved information of your game.

                          BEGINNING YOUR QUEST
Select BEGIN A NEW QUEST and press the A Button. The available
Adventure logs will appear. Select one. The window to register the
name of your character (who will be the leader of your party) will
appear (picture 4). Select letters with the +Control Pad and enter
them by pressing the A Button, one at a time. If you make a mistake,
use BACK to write over a letter.

Aliahan.
--------------------------------------------------------------
                                Page 6
GO TO SEE THE KING
Go straight ahead and enter the castle. Take the stairs in front of
you to get to the second floor. Approach the King and listen to what
he has to say. "Thy enemy shall be the Archfiend Baramos," says the
King. Trusting you to succeed, he will give you 50 pieces of Gold.

RECRUIT YOUR ALLIES
The King and his counselor say traveling alone will be too dangerous.
You need to organize an expedition party. At Luisa's Place, the eatery
located in the northwest corner of the castle town of Aliahan, you can
recruit up to three allies to help you in your quest. Walk up to the
counter in the back, face Luisa (the woman behind the counter) and
press the A Button. The Command Window will come up. Select TALK and
press the A Button to talk to her (picture 5). When asked what you
want, select ADD MEMBER. She will record the current conditions in the
Imperial Scrolls of Honor and show the list of available characters.
A customer in the eatery recommends you recruit a Soldier, a Pilgrim,
and a Wizard.

Initially three ready-made characters are available, but you can
register characters of your own creation. To do so, go upstairs to the
Adventurer's Hall of Registration. You can register up to 11
characters. You will probably enjoy your quest even more with your
favorite allies.

Registering Characters of Your Own Creation

If you want to register characters of your own creation, go to the
counter on the second floor of the eatery and select TALK. When the
window to register a name appears, enter a name. After selecting the
class and sex of the character, press the A Button to see his/her
pertinent information. If you like what you see, answer YES. Otherwise
answer NO. Repeat the process for additional characters. After you are
done, go downstairs to Luisa. Your newly registered characters should
appear on the list and you can add them to your party.

                              Page 7
                         CLASS DESCRIPTION
Hero

The hero of Dragon Warrior III, you, can use weapons and armor well to
fight enemies fiercely. You also have the ability to cast spells. Some
of the spells which you learn will be exclusive to you.

Soldier

A fighting professional. The Soldier can be equipped with most weapons
and armor, and since his/her growth rate is high, he/she will become
powerful quite quickly. He/she is not too agile, though, and cannot
cast any spell.

Pilgrim

With the ability to cast mainly healing and indirect attack spells, a
Pilgrim can back your party up greatly in battles. He/she also has
relatively good STRENGTH and can be equipped with many weapons and
armor. At higher levels, he/she will learn powerful attack spells too.

Wizard

A specialist of attack spells. Even at lower levels, the Wizard can
use very effective attack spells. However, he/she lacks STRENGTH and
his/her Attack Power and Defense Power are low compared to those of
characters in teh other classes. The Wizard can be equipped with a
limited number of weapons and armor.

Fighter

A master of martial arts, the Fighter posesses a lean, strong body and
excellent AGILITY. As the level increases, his/her chance of delivering
a "tremendous hit" grows. Being a master of martial arts, he/she can
best fight bare-handed. When equipped with ordinary weapons, his/her
Attack Power may decrease.

Merchant

A Merchant is skillful at finding the most gold pieces. He/she also
posesses the exclusive ability to appraise items. To use his/her
appraisal ability, first select ITEM, then the Merchant's name, the
item to be appraised, and finally APPRAISE.

Goof-off

Without exaggeration, a useless living-being to take along in your
quest. The only redeeming quality, if any, is that his/her
irresponsible and unpredictable actions and remarks may make you laugh.
As Goof-off's level increases, his/her uselessness will become more and
more apparent. His/her LUCK is tremendous, however.

Sage

A super character, the Sage can learn all the spells of a Pilgrim and
Wizard. He/she cannot only fight well, but can be equipped with many
weapons and armor. No character can start as a Sage, however. The only
way to become a Sage is to gain enough Experience Points and have a
necessary class change.
--------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 8
TALK TO EVERYONE
People in the castle and the town may provide valuable information. You
speak with someone by facing them, selecting TALK in the Command Window
and pressing the A button. TALK to everyone in the castle town and in
the castle of Aliahan. Can you find out what your immediate task is? It
has something to do with locked doors...

EMBARK ON YOUR QUEST
Outside lurk many enemies. Fighting and defeating them in battles is
the way you gain Gold pieces and Experience Points. When a character's
HP (Hit Points) fall to zero, he/she dies. To restore HP, stay at an
inn. Both HP and MP (Magic Power) of your characters will be restored
to the maximum levels.

                     STORES AND OTHER FACILITIES

You will find item stores, weapon stores, House of Healings, and inns
in many towns, villages, and some unexpected places. Be sure to check
every item store and weapon store to see available merchandise.

ITEM STORES
They sell Medical Herbs and other items. You may also sell unneeded
belongings here. When two or more of you enter a store, you will be
asked to designate who is buying or selling the items. The total number
of your Gold pieces will be displayed at the upper right section of the
screen.

WEAPON STORES
They sell different kinds of weapons and armor. TALK to the owner
across the counter. He will show you what is for sale. Select what you
want to buy. If you do not see anything you want, press the B Button
to cancel.

INNS
By staying at an inn you and your allies can regain the maximum HP and
MP. The cost of staying, quoted by the innkeeper, covers your entire
party. Inns are open 24 hours a day to accommodate you at any time.

HOUSE OF HEALINGS
House of Healings perform services for members in your party who have
been poisoned, cursed, or deceased. The services available are
DETOXICATE, UNCURSE, and REVIVE. You must pay the proper fee for each
service.
-------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 9
VAULT (Located only in Aliahan)
The Vault is located near the entrance to Luisa's Place. You can leave
a minimum of 1000 pieces of Gold and belongings there for safekeeping.
Use the +Control Pad to set the amount. Yu can store your Gold there
for free, but to store your belongings will cost you...

VAULT CONROLS
[UP]: Increases the number
[LEFT]: Moves to the left
[RIGHT]: Moves to the right
[DOWN]: Decreases the number

                       ENDING A SESSION PROPERLY
Your quest in Dragon Warrior III will be a long and hard one. You,
along with your characters, must rest occasionally. When you wish to
take a rest, be sure to save the game by seeing one of the Kings and/or
other characters who have access to the Imperial Scrolls of Honor. Even
if you are continuing your quest, we recommend you save the game
periodically so you have the option of going back to the last saved
point.

HOW TO SAVE
Stand next to the King, Select TALK. The King will tell you how many
Experience Points you needs to go to the next level. Have your progress
recorded in the Imperial Scrolls of Honor. When asked if you wish to
continue your journey, answer NO to end the session.

             IMPORTANT: HOW TO TURN OFF THE POWER PROPERLY
After the King's message is displayed, the screen changes to the Ending
Instruction. Following the Instruction, turn the POWER off while
holding in the RESET Button on your NES. If you don't hold in the RESET
Button while turning off the POWER, you may damage your valuable saved
information and will not be able to continue from the point you saved!
To continue at a later time, select CONTINUE A QUEST in the Option
Screen, then your Adventure Log.

                          THE TWO WINDOWS
The two windows you see often, besides the Text Window are the Command
Window and the Status Window (see picture 6).

THE COMMAND WINDOW
Displays available commands. To learn how to use these commands, see
the section entitled COMMANDS IN THE WALKABOUT MODE.

THE STATUS WINDOW
Displays information about you and your allies. H and M stand for Hit
Points and Magic Power, respectively. The numbers in the bottom row
show the characters' Levels. Beside each Level number is the class of
the character.

PAY ATTENTION TO THE COLOR OF WINDOWS
White: The normal color.
Green: Someone is seriously injured.
Orange: Someone is deceased.
Blue: It is night.

WHAT ARE DE, PO, NM, SL, AND CF?
When one of these appears where the Level number is usually displayed,
it means the character is not in a normal state due to enemies' spells,
poison, or other factors.

DE The character is deceased.
   Suggested Remedy: Take him/her to any House of Healing and ask for
   the service, REVIVE. If any of your party knows a spell to revive a
   deceased character, use it.
PO The character is poisoned.
   Suggested Remedy: Unless treated the character will remain poisoned,
   and for each step taken he/she will lose Hit Points. Use Antidote
   Herb on the character. Your allies may learn a spell with an
   antidotal effect.
NM The character's entire body is numb and immobile.
   Suggested Remedy: The effect goes away very gradually but to end the
   numbness quickly, use Full Moon Herb on the character. Your allies
   may learn a spell which expels numbness.
SL The character is put to sleep.
   Suggested Remedy: Defeat the enemies in the current battle
   completely or break away successfully. Your allies may learn a spell
   which wakes up the affected character.
CF The character is confused and disoriented.
   Suggested Remedy: Defeat the enemies in the current battle
   completely or break away successfully.

-------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 13
                      CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES (INFO)
LEVEL
The level of the character. By defeating enemies, some Experience
Points will be gained and the character's level increases. As the level
increases, the character's maximum HP and MP increase, and depending on
the class of the character, he/she will learn different magic spells.

HP (Hit Points)
The character's Hit Points decrease when enemies inflict damage.
Walking while poisoned or through damage inflicting terrain, such as
barrier and poisonous swamp, will also decrease Hit Points. The
character is defeated when his/her Hit Points fall to zero.

MP (Magic Points)
This is the power to chant spells. Each time a spell is chanted, MP
decreases.

G (Gold)
The total number of Gold pieces you and your allies possess.

STRENGTH
This is the character's power. More STRENGTH means more Attack Power.

AGILITY
This is the quickness of the character. It affects the order of action
taken in battles.

VITALITY
This is the character's capacity to grow. This affects the way MAX HP
increase.

IQ
This affects the way MAX MP increase and how fast the character learns
new magic spells.

LUCK
This determines how lucky the character gets when faced with danger.
The character with higher LUCK has a better chance of RUNning away from
and evading enemies' magic spells.

MAX HP (Maximum Hit Points)
The highest number of Hit Points attainable by the character at his/her
current level. By staying at an inn, all characters will regain their
Maximum Hit Points.

MAX MP (Maximum Magic Power)
Like MAX HP, the maximum magic power will be regained by staying at an
inn.

ATTACK POWER
This indicates how much damage the character can inflict upon enemies
with each attack. This figure is equal to the sum of the character's
STRENGTH and equipped weapon's attack power.

DEFENSE POWER
This indicates how well the character can minimize the damage inflicted
by enemies. This figure is equal to the sum of a half of the
character's AGLILITY and the total defense power of equipped armor,
shield, and helmet.

EXPERIENCE POINTS(EXP)
As a character defeats enemies, a certain number of Experience Points
will be gained. When a character accumulates enough Experience Points,
he/she will be promoted to the next level. The number gained depends on
two factors: how strong the defeated enemies are and how many of you it
took to defeat them. For example, if a single character encounters
enemies and defeats them, he/she will gain a greater amount of
Experience Points than he/she would with the aid of allies.

                                Page 14
                      EXAMPLE: TRANSFER AND EQUIP
Suppose you purchased a Magic Knife and would like to give the Copper
Sword to the Soldier. You can do this in the following manner:

TRANSFER the Copper Sword to the Soldier
Select ITEM in the Command Window and press the A Button. The window
containing names will appear. Select your name and press the A Button.
You can now select the item you wish to TRANSFER (picture 8). Select
Copper Sword in the list and press the A Button.

When the window with the commands USE, TRANSFER, and DISCARD appears,
select TRANSFER and press the A Button. The window with member names
will appear. Select the Soldier's name (picture 9) and press the A
Button. The Soldier now has the Copper Sword.

EQUIP the Soldier with the Copper Sword
Select EQUIP in the Command Window and press the A Button. When names
are displayed, select the Soldier's name (picture 10). Move the > to
Copper Sword with the +Control Pad and press the A Button (picture 11).
Note: E mark is now beside Copper Sword. The E mark points to the item
that is currently equipped. Now the Soldier is armed with the Copper
Sword. You can cycle forward through all equipment windows by pressing
the A Button and backward by pressing the B Button.

                     COMMANDS IN THE FIGHTING MODE
To reach higher levels, you and your allies must fight many different
enemies and gain Experience Points by defeating them. When you come
across an enemy or a band of enemies, you will automatically enter the
Fighting Mode.

As soon as you enter the mode, the number and kinds of enemies are
shown and the Fighting Command Window appears. Decide what you and your
allies should do and specify appropriate actions using the following
commands.

FIGHT
This command will let you attack your enemies with the equipped weapon
(bare-handed when not equipped with anything). Specify which enemy or
group of enemies you intend to attack.

RUN
Select this command and you and your allies will try to RUN away from
the enemies. Watch HP (Hit Points) in the Status Window and if you feel
Hit Points are dangerously low, try to RUN away. Keep in mind, though,
enemies may block your path so that you won't be able to escape.

PARRY To keep fighting when Hit Points are low may hasten the
character's complete defeat. Using PARRY, you can let the character
concentrate on defense so the amount of damage inflicted by the enemies
can be reduced by about one half.

SPELL
Select this command and press the A Button. The list of magic spells
available to the character will appear. Select which spell to cast with
the +Control Pad and press the A Button.

If the character can use more magic spells than can be displayed in
one window, you will see the =) mark near the upper left corner of the
window. Move ) to =) and press the A Button (picture 12). The next
window will be displayed. Keep repeating until you reach the window you
want.

If the magic spell to be cast is of the attack type, specify which
group of enemies to attack (picture 13).
-------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 16
If the magic spell is of the defensive type, specify which member of
your party should be affected. To do so, move ) to =) and press the A
Button first to display the members of your party and then select the
name.
Note: Some spells do not require you to designate intended targets.

ITEM
One example of this command is the use of a Medical Herb to restore Hit
Points during a battle. Another example is to cast the spell effect of
certain weapons and items. For instance, Thor's Sword has an effect
identical to the Firevolt spell when USEd during a battle. Like the
SPELL command, you many need to specify who these items will be used
on. During a battle, you may not transfer or throw away items; however,
you may change the weapon you fight with.

If you have entered a command which you wish to change, push the B
Button. Each time you press the B Button, the previous window will
appear.

When all actions to be taken are specified, a round of a battle begins.
The order of execution of the actions by participants in a battle
depends on their Agility. The battle ends when one side is completely
defeated, the Fighting Command Window will appear so that you may
specify your choices of actions for the next round.

Note: If there are more selections than can be displayed in one window,
you will see the =) mark near the upper left corner of the window. Move
) to =) and keep pressing the A Button until you reach the window you
want.

                             DAY AND NIGHT
In Dragon Warrior III, the passage of time has a profound effect. For
example, you may find certain people only during the day and others
only during the night. What people say might change depending upon when
you talk to them, too. It is recommended that you visit the same place
during the day as well as during the night.

FIVE LEVELS OF SCREEN BRIGHTNESS
Only while moving in the field, will time pass. When you are in safe
places such as cities and towns or while you are standing in field,
time will not pass.

HOW DAY AND NIGHT DIFFER

	YOU CAN'T VISIT A KING
	At most castles, guards will stop you from entering if you
	visit at night.

	MOST STORES CLOSE AT NIGHT
	Most stores close at night; however, some stores are open at
	night, and you may find special items at these stores. Inns and
	House of Healings are open 24 hours a day.

	ENEMIES ARE MORE ACTIVE AT NIGHT
	The chance of encountering enemies increases at night. Also
	enemies' party formations are more complicated at night and
	some enemies appear only after dark.

FOUR WAYS TO REVERSE DAY AND NIGHT

	STAY AT AN INN
	Stay at any inn and when you wake up, it will always be
	morning.

	CHANT RETURN
	After you use the magic spell, Return, it will be morning.

	USE LAMP OF DARKNESS
	If you possess the Lamp of Darkness, use it. When you light the
	lamp, you can turn day into night.

	CHANT DAY-NIGHT
	Chanting this magic spell will turn day into night and night
	into day.

                         MORE ABOUT FIGHTING

1. WATCH OUT FOR ENEMIES' SPECIAL ATTACK
Some enemies have the special ability to inflict damage on you in
addition to their ordinary attack habits. Their Special Attack
capabilities are listed below. The magic spell, StopSpell, cannot block

                                         appear.

2. DIVIDE THE TASK
During the fight, divide the task of defeating the enemies. While the
Hero, the Soldier, and the Fighter are attacking the enemies, the
Pilgrim should concentrate on backing them up with healing and
defensive magic spells. For example, to heal the ally with low HP using
Heal, Healmore, Healall, etc., cause a group of enemies to flee with
Expel, and increase allies' Agility with SpeedUp. The Wizard who can
use attack spells, which work on a group of enemies or all enemies,
should specialize in attacking a group of enemies. The Soldier and the
Fighter, who cannot use spells, should be assigned to attack an
individual enemy.

3. PROTECT THE WEAK OR INJURED ALLY
After each battle, check to see who is injured most. If no remedy is
available, move the weakest or most injured further down in the line
formation. The closer one is to the front, the more damage he/she will
recieve in battle.
----------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 19
4. KNOW THE AGILITY OF YOUR ALLIES AND ENEMIES

	A. Bad Example 1: Misjudging Enemies' Agility
In each round, the order of turn taken by participants depends on their
Agility. You must assess the Agility of each participant. For example,
even if you inted to USE a Medical Herb on an injured ally, the
quicker enemy may attack the ally, defeating him/her before the Medical
Herb is administered.

	B. Bad Example 2: Misjudging Your Allies' Agility
Likewise, not assessing the Agility of your allies can result in
inefficient manuevers. For example, you intend to use the Defence spell
to lower enemies' defense power. But the member with higher agility
than the one who is to cast the spell may attack the enemies without
benefitting from the spell's effect.

5. SURROUND, SLEEP, AND STOPSPELL: THE THREE BASIC SPELLS
Be an expert in using not only direct attack spells but also these
three indirect attack spells. These are learned near the beginning of
the game and could be used quite effectively. At the start of a battle,
use these spells to decieve (Surround) enemies, put them to sleep
(Sleep), and block their spells (StopSpell).
-----------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 20
6. CAST SPELLS ON YOUR ALLIES

	A. Put the Member Who Is Confused To Sleep
Some enemies, such as Derangers, cast the Chaos spell which has a
devestating effect on your party. Affected members become confused and
disoriented and can attack your allies! Rather than allowing him/her to
be a menace, put him/her to sleep with the Sleep Spell. To designate
the party member to be put to sleep, move > to => near the upper left
corner of the enemy information window and press the A Button. The
window which shows the name of your party members will appear.

	B. Transform into a Deceased Ally and Revive the Ally
The spell, Transform, can transform the user into any member of the
party. One ultimate example of this usage is transforming into the
deceased Pilgrim who could cast the Revive spell. After the
transformation, use Revive to bring the Pilgrim back to life! However,
transforming back to the original self during the battle is not
possible.

	C. Get a Supply of MP from Your Ally
The spell, RobMagic, consumes no Magic Power. When the MP level of a
certain character decreases, he/she can use RobMagic on another member
of the party with high MP to get some of his/her MP. Of course, this
spell can be used on enemies with MP; however, it may not always work.
Using it on allies always works.

THE FIRST THINGS TO DO
As your mother tells you, go see the King of Aliahan. "Thy enemy shall
be the Archfiend Baramos," says the King. After recieving 50 pieces of
Gold from the King, go to Luisa's Place as the King's counselor
advises. At Luisa's Place, recruit 3 allies. (Several ready-made
characters are available at Luisa's Place, but you can register
characters of your own creation at the Adventurer's Hall of
Registration.) The recommended characters to recruit are a Soldier, a
Pilgrim, and a Wizard. If you have difficulty doing any of the above,
refer to Section I. The procedures are explained in more detail.

BUY MEDICAL HERBS, ANTIDOTE HERBS, AND A WING OF WYVERN
Before leaving the town to embark on your quest, buy some Medical
Herbs, Antidote Herbs, and at least one Wing of Wyvern at the item
store. USE Medical Herbs to restore some HP, Antidote Herbs to
neutralize poison, and the Wing of Wyvern to quickly return to Aliahan.

TALK TO EVERYONE
TALK to everyone in the town and in the castle. Even TALK to the
prisoners kept in cells located in the basement of the castle.
You should be able to gather all the neccessary information to let you
proceed smoothly in the game by TALKing to everyone (including
animals) you encounter. Be sure to come back and open the locked doors
as soon as you get proper keys. You will be able to gain more
information and/or items.
---------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 23
FIGHT ENEMIES AND BUILD UP LEVELS
Go out and fight enemies, but don't venture too far at first. Carefully
watch the HP of each member of your party. USE Medical Herbs to restore
HP. Go back to Aliahan and stay at the inn or your home to restore the
maximum HP and MP.

Around the town of Aliahan, you will encounter only weak enemies like
Slimes and Black Ravens. Fight them and build up your levels to around
3 before you start exploring areas far from the castle town of Aliahan.

                           They Say.....
* The Key made by a thief, Bakor, can open doors with simple locks.
* The old man in the Tower of Najima stole the Key from Bakor.
* You can go to the Tower of Najima from the cave on the promontory
  nearby.
* There is a village of Reeve to the north.

Wing of Wyvern       25      N/A

Before going to the Tower of Najima, you may want to visit this
village. Some of the enemies around the village should give you a good
challenge before you will be ready for the Tower of Najima.

                             They Say...
* There is a cave in the forest south of the village that connects to
  the Tower of Najima.

         THE CAVE ON PROMONTORY & THE TOWER OF NAJIMA - Level 4

This is the first cave you explore in Dragon Warrior III. You should
have heard in Aliahan that the old man of this tower stole Bakor's key
which should open all doors with simple locks.

TWO WAYS TO ENTER THE TOWER OF NAJIMA
You can enter the Tower of Najima either through the cave on the
promontory near the castle town of Aliahan or through the cave in the
forest south of the village of Reeve.

USE THE INN
Strange as it may seem, there is an inn in the tower. Use the inn as
often as necessary to restore your HP and MP. You can get there through
a stairway on the second floor.

GET TREASURES
When you see a treasure chest, walk over to it, bring up the Command
Screen by pressing the A Button, select SEARCH, and press the A Button.
You will open the treasure chest and take whatever is inside.
-------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 25

USE THE WING OF WYVERN
If you have a Wing of Wyvern, you can return to any place you have
previously visited. After you find the Thief's Key, jump off the tower.
Once outside, USE the Wing of Wyvern to return to the castle town of
Aliahan. If you don't have one, you must walk into the tower, find your
way out of hte cave, and walk all the way back to the castle town of
Aliahan.

USE THE KEY
Use the key to open all Thief's Key Doors in the castle of Aliahan and
the village of Reeve. TALK to everyone behind them. You will gain more
information and a very important item you will need to proceed in the
game.

                         They Say...(Aliahan)
* The Travel Door used to be in the easternmost part of Aliahan region.
* You can break open the seal of the Travel Door using the Magic Ball.
* There is an old man who makes Magic Balls in the village of Reeve.

                          They Say...(Reeve)
* There is a small lake over the mountains to the east of the village.

                   THE CAVE OF ENTICEMENT - Level 8

If you have a Magic Ball and the levels of you and your allies are
around 8, go east of the village of Reeve  and over the mountains.
Don't forget to take with you a lot of Medical Herbs and Antidote
Herbs. Quite strong enemies are lurking there! It is a good idea to
keep at least one Wing of Wyvern so you can retreat quickly.

BREAK THE SEAL OF THE TRAVEL DOOR
The cave leading to the Travel Door is sealed with a set of stone
walls. USE the Magic Ball in front of it. Watch the seal break and
proceed.
--------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 27

FIND THE TRAVEL DOOR AND STEP ON IT
The Travel Door you heard about in Aliahan is in this cave. It looks
like a little pond. If you find it, walk over to it and stand still.
The screen image will start wiggling and black out eventually. Don't
panic. There is nothing wrong with your NES Control Deck or the Game
Pak. You are just being transported to another Travel Door. When the
transport is complete, the image will return back and settle down. Now
you are at the Travel Door near the castle of Romaly. Upon exiting the
chamber, you should head north.

TRY YOUR LUCK AT THE FIGHT RING
Gamblers at the Fight Ring are betting on monster battles. You may try
your luck there, but don't get hooked! You have more important things
to do!

DO YOU NEED THE SERVICE OF REVIVE?
Passing through the Cave of Enticement may have been very rough. There
is a House of Healing in Romaly. It is located on the west side of the
castle of Romaly near the gate.

                             They Say.....
* Someone called Kandar stole the Golden Crown from the King.
* Kandar is living in the Tower of Shanpane with his men.
* The Tower of Shanpane looms far to the west of the village of Kanave.
* The village of Kanave is far to the north of Romaly.

------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 29

You are probably too weak yet to face Kandar at the Tower of Shanpane.
You'd better gain more Experience Points around this village. Go to the
eatery located in the northwest corner of the village. TALK to the
customers there.

WHERE IS THE POISON NEEDLE?
The old man by the pond in the village says the item store once stocked
the Poison Needle. But the store owner no longer offers one for sale.
Maybe it is hidden in the store. Why don't you try sneaking into his
place while he is asleep?

USE THE VAULT OFTEN
There is a vault in the castle town of Aliahan. You can leave Gold
pieces and items there for safe keeping. Each member of your party
can carry up to 8 items. It is important to carry only the most
important items because you must have room to accommodate new items you
will find. Use the vault to keep items you don't need at the moment but
may want to use later.
	It is wise to deposit most of your Gold pieces in the vault. If
your party is destroyed, the person who saved your progress last time
will resurrect you, but at a cost, half of the Gold pieces in your
posession to be exact. By keeping most of your Gold pieces in the
vault, you can minimize your losses greatly. If you use the Return
spell to get back to the castle town of Aliahan, visiting the vault is
not much trouble; be prudent and use the vault often.

                              They Say...
* There is a village which was put to sleep because the villagers made
  some elves angry.

                   THE VILLAGE OF NOANIELS - Level 12

Inn: 5 Gold per person

The couple in the Kanave village eatery spoke of this place. Everyone
seems to be asleep...except an old man on the second floor of the
building located in the southwest section of the village.

USE INDIRECT ATTACK SPELLS
Enemies around Kanave and Noaniels are considerably tougher than the
ones you find around Aliahan. Rather than attacking them directly, let
the Pilgrim use some of the indirect attack spells, such as Sleep,
SpeedUp, and Sap.

BEWARE OF AVENGER RAVENS
They are more dangerous than they look because they attack twice in
each turn. The only recommended survival measure available at this
stage of the game is to always maintain high HP levels.

                              They Say...
* The hidden village of elves is in the west forest.
* The spell on the village will be broken if the Dream Ruby is returned
  to the elves.

There is an item store in the village, but hating humans as they do,
elves don't want your business. They may have some valuable items. Only
if you can disguise yourselves as some other beings, might they....

                              They Say...
* An elfin girl, Anne, loved a human male.
* She took the Dream Ruby and went to him never to return.

                 THE CAVE WEST OF NOANIELS - Level 13

USE THE HEALING SPRING INSIDE
The Healing Spring is located on the second basement level. Walk to the
center of the Spring. The HP and the MP will be restored to their
manimum. Use the spring as many times as necessary.

DO YOU KNOW? 1.
You can move an often-used item, such as the Thief's Key, to the top of
your item list. TRANSFER to yourself the item above the one you want
to move to the top. Repeat the process until the often used item comes
to the top.
----------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 32

WATCH OUT FOR DEADLY TOADSTOOLS
They are especially dangerous because they can put you to sleep during
a battle. Once put to sleep, you can only hope you wake up before they
completely defeat you. So try to defeat them quickly. The IceBolt spell
seems to work.

RETREAT QUICKLY
The enemies in this cave are strong. If the situation becomes
unfavorable, try to retreat. By now, the Wizard should have learned the
Outside spell, and the Hero the Return Spell. Retreat quickly and
easily using the Outside (to get out of the cave) and Return (to return
to the place of your choice) spells.

TAKE THE DREAM RUBY TO ANNE'S MOTHER
As soon as you find the Dream Ruby in the cave, take it to Anne's
mother in the Hidden Village of Elves. She will give you the Wake Up
Powder in gratitude. USE the powder in the village of Noaniels. People
will start waking up. TALK to the people. Some should tell you what to
do next.

                              They Say...
* The Spider's Web will slow monsters down.
* Long ago, there was a rumor about the Magic Key in Assaram.
* The town of Assaram is to the east of Romaly.

DO YOU KNOW? 2.
You can USE the following weapons during a battle to possibly inflict
the same damage as the corresponding spell without consuming any MP.

                   THE TOWER OF SHANPANE - Level 14

JUMP FROM THE 6TH FLOOR
After the long climb in the tower, you found Kandar and his men on the
6th floor. But when you fell into his trap, they escaped. Returning to
the 6th floor, you find no sign of them and the treasures have
dissappered as well. Where have they gone? The open wall to the north
suggests they...

GIVE KANDAR AND HIS MEN A LESSON
They are many times stronger than the enemies you have encountered.
Before confronting them, be sure to restore the maximum HP of every
member in your party. The recommended approach is to defeat each of
Kandar's men first while putting Kandar to sleep with the Sleep spell.
The IceBolt spell seems to work. You may be able to defeat Kandar's men
in three rounds or so. After they are gone, the four of you can give
Kandar a good workout. If he is not asleep, though, his attack can be
devestating.
--------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 34

TAKE THE TREASURE
If you succeed in defeating Kandar and his men, they will leave you a
treasure chest. Inside, you will find an item wanted by the King of
Romaly. Take it to the King.

BECOME THE NEW KING OF ROMALY
The King of Romaly, overjoyed wiht the return of the Golden Crown,
insists you assume his position. He just doesn't take "NO" for an
answer...You can proudly say to your friends you finished Dragon
Warrior III in record time by becoming the King of Romaly and living
happily ever after...

IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE YOUR QUEST...
If you don't want to indulge in the easy life of royalty but would like
to continue your quest, find the former King and make your request. But
where is he? His father (in the east tower) says his son likes having a
good time. Is he having a good time gambling at the Fight Ring?

An old man in the village of Noaniels revealed he has heard a rumor
about the Magic Key in Assaram. TALK to everyone in the town of Assaram
to learn more about the key.

NEGOTIATE THE PRICE
The weapon store in the northwest section of the town is of dubious
nature. It may have some wares you really want, but don't agree on the
first price the owner offers. Even after negotiating, the price he
settles on may be too high!

VISIT THIS TOWN DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT
This town has two faces: one for the day and the other for the night.
There is at least one store which is only open at night. you may also
see other people at night.

                              They Say...
* If you walk along the mountains south of the desert, you will come to
  a shrine.
* A country named Isis lies in the desert to the west.
* The Poison Powder can confuse a monster.

Believing the information you obtained in the town of Assaram, you
traveled south in the desert along the mountains and found a small
shrine in a swamp. The old man inside said the Magic Key lay in the
Pyramid in the northern desert. He also advised you to visit the castle
of Isis first. Why? Is there something you need there?

LOOK FOR THE METEORITE ARMBAND IN THE CASTLE
There is a man in the town who says wearing the Meteorite Armband makes
him faster. If you see the owner of the weapon store at night, he will
reveal that the Meteorite Armband is in the castle. There is a path by
the wall of the castle. Try entering it on the west side of the gate.
If you find the Meteorite Armband, select it from the liast of items
through the ITEM command and USE it to put it on. The wearer's Agility
is now doubled! Anyone can wear it, but probably having the Pilgrim
wear it will benefit your party most because he/she will be able to
cast indirect attack or defensive spells faster than before.

                               They Say...
* In the north desert, there is a royal grave called Pyramid.
* In the Pyramid there is a place where spells won't work.
* There is a secret to the Pyramid in the songs the children sing.

                        THE PYRAMID - Level 16
You heard the Magic Key was hidden in the Pyramid. Doesn't the sealed
stone wall on the third floor look suspicious? Sorry the Magic Ball
doesn't work on this one. There must be a way to open it.

SPELLS DON'T WORK IN SOME SECTIONS
As someone in Isis said, there are sections in the Pyramid where spells
don't work. Be sure to always carry a sufficient number of herbs.

MAKE MANY TRIPS
Besides the Magic Key, the Pyramid contains many more treasures. But be
prepared for strong monsters hiding in some treasure chests. Don't
expect to retrieve all of the treasures in one trip.

OPEN THE SEALED WALL
Remember the song the children in the castle of Isis were singing. It
contained a clue to the mechanism of opening the sealed wall.
----------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 38
WHAT IS THE GOLDEN CLAW?
There is a second basement under the Pyramid. SEARCH the entire floor
of the first basement. You should find a hidden stairway. SEARCH around
a casket in the second basement. There you will find the Golden Claw.
Take it and you will notice a dramatic increase in your chance of
encountering enemies. This is a plus if you want to build up levels
quickly. What! You don't want it? Then sell it at an item store. You 
will be richer by 11,250 Gold pieces! However, it is awfully difficult
to make it to any store alive with the Golden Claw!

GO BACK TO THE CASTLE OF ISIS
There are a few Magic Key Doors int he castle of Isis. Go there and
open all of them. The guards won't let you in? Try sneaking in at night
when they've left their post. If you succeed in seeing the Queen in her
chamber, she will give you an item which will enable you to restore
some MP.

GATHER MORE INFORMATION IN ASSARAM
Visit Assaram again, perhaps at night, to gather more information.
Consult the leader of the dance troop in the backstage of the theater.
Try opening all hte doors you see with the Magic Key and TALK to all
the people behind them.

                          They Say...(Assaram)
* In the craggy mountains, there is a cave that connects to the eastern
  lands.
* There is a secret passage to the east, but Norud the Dwarf won't
  reveal the passage.
* Norud's friend, the King of Portoga, may be able to help.

Scroll. Take it to Norud the Dwarf.

                            They Say...
* There is a shrine to change occupations in the east.
* If you bring the King some black pepper, he will give you a ship.

cave near the town of Assaram. This cave connects to the eastern lands.
-------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 40

READ NORUD THE DWARF THE ROYAL SCROLL
Inside the cave, you find Norud the Dwarf. he is not friendly at first.
Read Norud the Royal Scroll from the King of Portoga (by choosing the
ITEM command, then the Royal Scroll and USE) Acknowledging the King's
request, he will make a hole in the cave to the secret passage. Proceed
through the passage, and you will come up in the eastern lands.

                             They Say...
* There is a store which usually carries black pepper.
* The store is not in business because the owner's daughter, Tania,
  was Kidnapped.
* The Kidnappers live in a cave nearby.
* Deep in the northern mountains is the Shrine of Dhama where you can
  change your profession.

                  THE CAVE EAST OF BAHARATA - Level 19

USE THE X-RAY SPELL
The Wizard in your party has probably learned the X-Ray spell. If so,
use the spell before opening a treasure chest. If the chest glows red,
a monster is inside. If the chest glows blue, it is safe to open.
------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 41

FREE THE COUPLE
Tania and Galen are locked up in the cells on the second basement
level. Let them escape, then confront the kidnappers, Kandar and his
men. Kandar is even stronger than before. Again concentrate on his men
first. Generally, spells do not seem effective against Kandar, so don't
waste MP. You probably need to go through many rounds to defeat Kandar
alone. Don't be discouraged even if he seems undefeatable!

GO BACK TO THE STORE IN BAHARATA
Galen is safely back and working in the store. TALK to him. He will
gladly give you some Black Pepper.

RECIEVE A SHIP FROM THE KING OF PORTOGA
Take the Black Pepper to the King of Portoga and he will give you a
ship as promised. Go aboard the ship at the dock outside of the castle.
You are now ready for more exciting and challenging parts of your
quest!

                THE SHRINE SOUTH OF PORTOGA - Level 19

Drop by the small shrine on the promontory near Portoga and TALK to the
man downstairs.

                              They Say...
* If you go south, you'll go around the cape of Tedanki. Going further
  along the shoreline you will reach Baharata, and finally Jipang.
* If you collect six (6) Orbs scattered throughout the world, you can
  travel anywhere without a ship.

a lone body in a prison cell. Try TALKing to the body. You will find a
scrawl on the wall nearby. It displays a strange message...

Be sure to come back at night. You will see many people (or ghosts?).
TALK to them. You will gain some valuable information. You will even
find an inn and a weapon store. The store carries expensive but
excellent weapons and armor.

                              They Say...
* The scrawl by the body says, "I wanted to give someone the Orb I had

A girl asks you to buy an Invisibility Herb at the store her father
runs. A man by the shrine suggests you go to Eginbear if you have an
Invisibility Herb. The Invisibility Herb isn't cheap, but it may prove
a very valuable posession.

                            They Say...
* To obtain the Final Key, you need some kind of vase.
* The Vase of Drought is supposed to be in the castle of Eginbear in
  the island country to the north of Portoga.
* If you have an Invisibility Herb, go to Eginbear.
* Fron the shrine, you can go to the cave known as the Navel of the
  Earth.

DID YOU KNOW? 4.
You should choose the type of direct attack spells according to the
enemy type.

For example, many enemies in the sea, such as King Squids and Crabus,
accomstumed to cold sea water, have strong immune systems against the
spells in the Frigid Family (IceBolt, SnowBlast, etc.) You should use
spells in the other families, such as Blaze and Firebal against them.
On the other hand, you should use spells in the Frigid Family against
enemies who breathe out blaze, such as Lava Bashers and Orochi. The
spells in the Blaze Family seem to have no effect on them.

The guard at the gate won't let you pass because you are yokels. He
doesn't like your looks, so fool him by becoming invisible.

USE the Invisibility Herb you purchased at the Village of Lancel. Move
along quickly because the effect does not last long.

ARRANGE THE 3 BOULDERS ON THE BLUE FLOOR
There is a chamber with three boulders in the basement of the castle.
You must arrange the 3 boulders on the blue floor. This is a puzzle.
You can push but cannot pull a boulder. Have fun! If you make a
mistake, exit the chamber and re-enter to start over. If you cannot
arrange the 3 boulders on the blue floor, see the hint on page 78. When
you succeed, you will...

CHECK THE KING'S CHAMBER AT NIGHT
The King's counselor is doing something he doesn't want others to know
about. For agreeing to keep quiet about it, he will tell you
something...

                               They Say...
* A vase which has the power to dry up the ocean exists in this world.
* Long ago a shrine sunk into the ocean and now there are shoals there.
* On the shore of the continent to the west there is a small field
  surrounded by trees.

                        THE FIELD - Level 19

The King's Counselor in Eginbear mentioned the existence of the field
surounded by trees on the shore of the western continent. There is an
old man here. His vision is to build a new town, but he needs the help
of a merchant...

HELP THE OLD MAN
Won't you help this poor old man fulfill his dream. Bring him a
merchant from Aliahan! Go back to the castle town of Aliahan, to the
Adventurer's Hall of Registration on the second floor of Luisa's Place,
register a Merchant, and bring the Merchant here. (You must LEAVE one
of your allies at Luisa's Place before ADDing the Merchant to your
party.) If you haven't learned how to change a party member, refer to
Section I, page 6.
The Merchant doesn't need much experience. Just be sure to bring
him/her to the field alive! You should keep him/her last in your
formation for the best protection. (Use STATUS, then FORMATION to
change the line-up.)

TALK TO THE OLD MAN
TALK to the old man after presenting the Merchant to him...Overjoyed
with the hope of fulfilling his dream, he will give you some
information.

WATCH OUT FOR HADES' CONDORS
They can use the Limbo spell on you and your allies. The spell will
send the affected character away to limbo! If you are unfortunate
enough to experience this, don't panic. You can always re-start the
game, right? If you don't want to start over, you can look for the
missing character. He/she will be returned to this world unscathed. You
just need to find him/her. If you cannot, see the hint on page 78.

                              They Say...
*Check the area around the well in the Village of Soo, located in the
 middle of this continent.

TALK TO EVERYONE AND EVERY ANIMAL
At least one animal in this village talks and can give you a clue as to
where the Vase of Drought should be used.

                              They Say...
* A great wizard lives in a field on the ice-covered island. Greenlad,
  in the north sea.
* Use the Vase of Drought in the shoals of the western ocean.
* The Echoing Flute is in a Tower somewhere.
* If you play the Echoing Flute in a place where an orb is near, an
  echo will come back.

                      THE SHOALS - Level 20

If you TALKed to the talking horse in the village of Soo, you know
where to look for the shoals. There you may use the Vase of Drought.

USE the Vase of Drought by the shoals in the ocean west of the village
of Soo. Enter the shrine which surfaces from the ocean. Inside you will
see a treasure chest containing the Final Key. With that key, you will
be able to open all types of doors! Begin with the door in the shrine.

                              They Say...
* There is a great pit called Giaga, deep in the mountains of
Necrogond. All misfortunes emanate from that pit.

GO TO THE VILLAGE OF TEDANKI AT NIGHT
Do you remember the cell in the village of Tedanki which had a scrawl
on the wall? At night, a guard blocks the opening to the cell, but
there is a door there and you now have the Final Key. Enter the cell at
night and TALK to the prisoner. He will give you an important
item...Don't forget to TALK to him after recieving the item.

                           They Say...(Tedanki)
* There is an altar in Liamland in the distant south of Tedanki to
  place an orb on.

                          THE GREENLAD - Level 20

Someone in the village of Soo mentioned a great wizard living on the
island called Greenlad in the north sea. Go see him. To get to his
cabin, enter a little greenfield on the ice-covered island and
proceed straight ahead for awhile.

                              They Say...
* Many years ago, pirates came and left a strange bone.
* With the Staff of Change you can change your shape and the King of
  Samanao is rumored to have it.

                     THE SHRINE OF DHAMA - Level 20

Inn: 2 Gold per person

Before going to Samanao, navigate eastward along the shoreline around
Baharata. If you go up to the river to the east of Baharata, you will
find this shrine. To the left of the old man at the entrance to the
shrine, are the stairs to an inn and a House of Healing.

CONVENIENT PLACE TO SAVE
Use the Return spell to come here, and see the old man at the entrance.
He will record (save) your game.

CHANGE CLASS IF YOU LIKE
Anyone who has reached level 20 can have a class change. To do so,
enter the shrine and see the man in the middle. With a class change,
for example, a Wizard can become a Soldier. The new Soldier would not
learn any new spells but would be able to use all the spells learned
while he/she was the Wizard. Note the following:

1. After a Class Change, the character's attributes, such as STRENGTH,
AGILITY, and INTELLIGENCE will be halved and the level begins at 1
again.
2. The spells learned prior to a Class Change will not be forgotten,
but the special talent, such as Merchant's appraisal ability, will be
lost.
3. After a Class Change, each weapon and armor the character was
equipped with will be removed. Be sure to re-EQUIP him/her with
appropriate weapons and armor.

Make a copy of your current Adventure Log before attempting a class
change so that you may resume the pre-class-change condition if you
wish.

                  THE TOWER OF GARUNA - Level 21
------------------------------------------------------------
                             Page 49

Someone said the Book of Satori was in this tower. Even if you don't
want to have a class change, come here to gain Experience Points before
going to Jipang. This tower is not very spacious but should entertain
you for some time with intricate connections between rooms. On the
first floor, there are four Travel Doors. The right choice of doors
will get you to the other floors.

WHERE IS THE BOOK OF SATORI?
To reach some floors in this tower, you must fall from the tightropes
or fall into the traps. The Book of Satori is in a treasure chest on
one of these floors...

WHAT IS THE BOOK OF SATORI?
Anyone who wants to become a Sage must read this book to reach the
state of enlightenment before requesting for a class change.
(Possession alone will suffice.) Only the person who has this book at
the time of the class change will be offered the chance to become a
Sage. (In each quest, only one Book of Satori is available.)

              JIPANG AND THE CAVE OF JIPANG - Level 23

JIPANG
The Monster, Orochi, is terrorizing the villagers of Jipang. Himiko,
the female ruler, picks female offerings according to her own prophecy.
She seems cold-hearted and strange, especially at night...

                             They Say...
* Himiko has something like a crystal ball.
* Himiko makes a strange "Sss...Sss..." sound while sleeping.

THE CAVE OF JIPANG
Oozing with bright red molten lava, this cave looks hostile. However,
the cave itself is small and easy to travel. On the second basement
level, the monster, Orochi, awaits you.

CONFUSED?
Derangers are quite a menace because they can confuse and disorient you
and your allies with the Chaos spell. If this occurs, you may attack
each other! What can you do to stop the affected person(s) from 
attacking the others? The 
------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 51

only effective solution: put the affected person(s) to sleep 
(use the Sleep spell). If the Pilgrim is put to sleep, you are out of 
luck!

DEFEAT THE OROCHI
The Orochi has more than one head and consequently can attack you with
more than one blaze in each turn. The Sleep spell seems to work
sometimes, and the spells in the Frigid Family seem to work fairly
well. The Pilgrim might wish to decrease the defense power of the
Orochi at the beginning of a battle using Sap. He/she should also try
to maintain the HP of each member in the party at a sufficient level
while the Hero and the Soldier concentrate on delivering blows to the
Orochi.

CHASE THE DEFEATED OROCHI
Chase the defeated Orochi. It will lead you to Himiko's room. It seems
she suffered a terrible injury. Is she the Orochi? Restore the maximum
HP of each member in the party and TALK to her. Show no mercy as you
begin your battle with Himiko's true form...the Orochi. When you defeat
the Orochi for the second and final time, you will find...

Almost everyone in this remote village near icy fields thinks you have
a striking resemblance to Papagatero, who visited here a long time ago.
An old man says Papagatero was from Aliahan...and he was known as
O-R-T-E-G-A. You now know your father, Ortega, was once here. A kid
named Popota gives you his Water Blaster which Ortega made for him
while he was here. Good luck finding Popota!

WHAT IS THE WATER BLASTER?
The innocent looking device your father made while here must have some
special power, or so it seems. You try to USE it on each villager in
your way, and find to your amazement...the Water Blaster only excels
in surprising people with cool spurting water but in nothing
else...Well, that's all, folks! You'd better hurry!

                      THE TOWER OF ARP - Level 23

Someone in the village of Soo said the Echoing Flute was in a tower
somewhere. Is this the one?

JUMP OFF THE TIGHTROPE
There are four treasure chests on the third floor of this tower. The
path to reach them will not be easy. Once you reach the fifth floor and
walk toward the middle of the tightropes, mark your steps well and
jump. One of the four treasure chests contains...

                    THE HOUSE OF PIRATES - Level 21

At night, you can TALK to the pirates. They don't seem hostile. You can
expect to gather valuable information from them. The leader of the
pirates is a woman. Watch what you say when you TALK to her. If she
doesn't like the way you talk, she may withhold some important
information.

PLAY THE ECHOING FLUTE HERE
Play the Echoing Flute in the house. Do you hear the echoes? If so, an
Orb must be nearby.

USE THE VAULT OFTEN
You checked the basement of the house, and you found no Orb. Have you
checked the house's perimeter? Don't you think the boulder outside on
the east side of the house peculiar? SEARCH the area around or below
the boulder and you will find...

                              They Say...

* Long ago, they once saw a Phantom Ship wandering in the seas.
* They probably came across the Phantom Ship because they used the
  Sailor's Thigh Bone.
* They gave the bone to an old man in Greenlad.
* There is an island of Lugami to the south and slightly to the west of
  the House of Pirates.

                           LUZAMI - Level 23

On this forgotten island, there is a prophet. TALK to him, and he will
reveal your destiny. Also TALK to the man behind a counter in a little
building. He sells nothing, but has vital information for you.

SEARCH THE FLOWER GARDEN
You will find a not-so-vital item there...

                                They Say...
* The shrine of the Archfiend is deep in the mountains of the
  Necrogond.
* You will heave the Sword of Gaia into a volcano's crater, and your
  own path will unfold.
* The Sword of Gaia was possessed by a man called Simon.

                   THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH - Level 27

In the Village of Lancel, there is a big shrine on the north side. Go
there and open all the doors you see with the Final Key. Don't miss
doors around the gate of the shrine. TALK to everyone. There you will
find two prophets.

ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE
At the shrine, you alone will be asked to test your courage. Accept the
challenge, but be sure you are properly equipped. The Zombie Slasher,
the Magic Armor, the Iron Mask, and the Iron Shield should help you
meet the challenge. You should also carry the Final Key and wear (USE)
the Meteorite Armband for the occasion.

DON'T BE DISCOURAGED BY MIMICS
There are several treasure chests inside the cave. Some of them are
Mimics, lethal monster, which can cast the devestating Defeat spell. Be
sure to open every treasure chest. One of them contains a very
important item, and another a splendid suit of armor.

                             They Say...
* The companion you have parted with will help you fulfill your hopes.
* The Yellow Orb has passed from hand to hand and circled the globe.

                      THE NEW TOWN - Level N/A

Occasionally visit the New town and the Merchant you left with the old
man at the field surrounded by trees. (If you don't see any change
between each visit, take a short break between each visit or push the
RESET button on your NES. Be sure to save your progress before doing
either of these.)
-------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 56

Isn't it exciting to see the town growing? The Merchant seems to be
doing a good job of developing the town...
But after a few visits, you notice the towns people begin to complain
about the Merchant's way of doing business. Perhaps the Merchant has
become too greedy...

Keep visiting this new town. You will meet wayfarers who have traveled
farther than you. They will tell you new things. Eventually one of the
items you need, as a prophet in Lancel said, will end up in this
town...

Do you remember the Great Wizard on Greenlad? He said he wanted the
Staff of Change. He also said he had heard the rumor that the Staff of
Change was kept by the King of Samanao. It's time to visit Samanao.
--------------------------------------------------------------
                                Page 57

HOW TO GET HERE
To reach here for the first time, you must use Travel Doors. Find a
shrine to the south of Greenlad. Of the three Travel Doors inside, step
on the one to the right. (Use the other two Travel Doors and you will
gain information about the Promontory of Olivia.) Once transported,
venture to the north, cross the bridge, and walk to the southwest along
the mountains.

GET INTO THE CASTLE
The entrance is strictly guarded. Even Invisibility Herbs won't help.
If the front door doesn't work, try a back door. There is one for the
kitchen on the east side of the castle. Go to see the King in the
center of the castle. You will be caught by his guards and taken to the
jail downstairs. A short stay in the jail will provide valuable
information...

                               They Say...
* The "King" sleeps alone upstairs at night.
* Someone stole the Staff of Change from the true King and assumed his
  form.
* The Mirror of Ra which shows the true image of all those reflected in
  it, lies in a cave to the south.
* Simon rotted away in the jail of a shrine in a lake in the northeast
  of distant Romaly.

                THE CAVE SOUTHEAST OF SAMANAO - Level 28

A prisoner in samanao said you would find the Mirror of Ra in this
cave. The second basement is filled with many treasure chests. You can
be greedy for a moment and indulge yourselves in a treasure hunt, but
beward that some of them are Mimics; lethal monsters.
-------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 59

SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE "KING" OF SAMANAO
Once you have the Mirror of Ra, wait until night falls and sneak into
the King's chamber. (See the illustration of the castle of Samanao. If
you cannot figure out how to get to his chamber, see the hint on page
78.) Stand by the sleeping King and USE the Mirror of Ra. The true form
of the monster will be reflected upon the mirror. When defeated, the
monster will leave a treasure chest. It contains...

TRY THE STAFF OF CHANGE YOURSELF
The Staff of Change is too good to give to the Great Wizard without
giving it a try yourself. USE it to change your appearance. (See for
the first time the profiles of Slime!)

After having some fun with it, imagine ways to put the staff to real
use. Do you remember the item store in the Hidden Village of Elves?
They didn't want your business, but if you can assume the form of
Elves, they should treat you right. The Wizard's Ring and the Magic
Robe will be good buys.

USE THE VAULT OFTEN
Being thankful, he will give you the Sailor's Thigh Bone. This item
indicates the distance between you and the wandering Phantom Ship. USE
it to help you zero in on the ship.

DID YOU KNOW? 5.
You can reduce the potential damage enemies inflict by employing the
"PARRY-FIGHT" technique.

Select PARRY and press the A Button. Cancel the selection by pressing
the B. Button, and then select FIGHT and press the A Button. By
employing this technique, you can attack enemies while benefiting from 
the effect of PARRY. You may think the extra steps required a nuisance,
but this technique will be quite useful against strong enemies.

Notice the difference!
Right: Usual; Left: PARRY-FIGHT

                    THE PHANTOM SHIP - Level 28

It takes time to find the Phantom Ship, since it is sailing aimlessly
all over the world. If you find it, pull your ship alongside and board
the Phantom Ship. TALK to everyone (alive or not). In a room on the
lower deck, you will find some treasure chests. One of them contains
the Locket of Love. But which is it?

GO TO THE PROMONTORY OF OLIVIA
If you've TALKed to the old man at the Promontory of Olivia, you
should be able to guess what to do with the Locket of Love. While your
ship is being pulled back past the promontory by the curse of Olivia,
USE the Locket of Love. The curse will be lifted and you can now go
to...

GET INSIDE THE SHRINE JAIL IN THE LAKE
TALK to everything (including fires!) You will find the spirit of Simon
there and it will instruct you to SEARCH around his body. You will
find...

                   THE CAVE OF NECROGOND - Level 32
-------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 61

The prophet in Luzami said you would heave the Sword of Gaia into a
volcano's crater and your own path would unfold before you. Go to the
crater to the south of Assaram and heave (USE) the Sword of Gaia into
the crater. It will erupt, causing molten lava to flow into the river
and solidify, connecting the shore to the valley of Necrogond. Walk
south and you will reach the cave of Necrogond (if you are strong
enough.)

PENETRATE THE CAVE
On the other side of the cave, there is a tiny shrine. At this shrine,
you will find another Orb. Don't let the short distance between two
openings of the cave entice you to enter unprepared. Many monsters,
more powerful and devestating than any you have encountered so far,
await you inside. It will not be easy to reach the other side of the
cave, but don't give up. Make as many retreats as you need using the
Outside and Return spells.
Think of this cave as the last training ground before confronting the
Archfiend, Baramos. If you cannot penetrate this cave, you won't stand
a chance against Baramos.
Be sure to check every treasure chest while you are in the cave. Two of
the most sought-after weapons and armor are hidden in the cave: the
Lightning Sword and the Swordedge Armor.

                        LIAMLAND - Level 34

So you finally reached the other side of the cave of Necrogond and
recieved another Orb from the old man in the tiny shrine.

                          CONGRATULATIONS!

Now you have all six Orbs: Green, Purple, Red, Blue, Yellow, and
Silver. What? You don't have six Orbs yet? There is no point in coming
to Liamland unless you have them all! You must retreat and retrieve the
remaining Orbs. See page 79 if you need hints on locating the remaining
Orbs.

Take all six Orbs to the chamber in Liamland. Place one of the six Orbs
on each pedestal in the altar attended by twin maidens. (To place an
Orb, approach one of six pedestals, select ITEM, then an Orb, and
finally USE.) Colors are of no significance. You can place any Orb on
any pedestal.
After placing all six Orbs on the pedestals, wait patiently. The
legendary bird, Ramia, will resurrect before your eyes. She will fly
you to the castle of Baramos.

HOW TO RIDE RAMIA
To ride Ramia, move the lead character of your party over the back of
Ramia and press the A button. The rest of the party will follow. Using
the +Control Pad, direct Ramia to fly in the direction of your choice.
Your perseverance has paid off! Now you can soar over the land of
Dragon Warrior III.

HOW TO LAND
To land, press the A Button. Move your party, using the +Control Pad,
off Ramia. Note you cannot direct Ramia to land on places where you
cannot walk, such as craggy mountains and seas.

                    THE CASTLE OF BARAMOS - Level 34

After enjoying some relaxing excursions in the sky on Ramia, you set
out to launch and assault against "thy enemy," the infamous Archfiend
Baramos in the Necrogond...

The castle doesn't seem large, but even with a map you would have a
hard time navigating through the castle. Can you reach the chamber with
three treasure chests? One of them should contain the Demon Axe,
probably the strongest weapon a Soldier can be equipped with in the
world of Dragon Warrior III. (Be sure to EQUIP the Soldier with the
weapon as soon as you find it.)

In the basement of this castle, awaits Baramos. Can you find the way to
the basement? If you have trouble reaching the basement, see the hint
on page 79.
--------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 65

HOW TO FIGHT BARAMOS
Before the battle with Baramos begins, be sure to restore the maximum
HP of every memer of your party.
As soon as the battle starts, have the Wizard cast the Bikill spell on
allies to double their attack powers and have the Pilgrim or the Sage
cast the Increase spell to maximize their defense power.
You can be assured that no spell will work on Baramos. So don't waste
turns or valuable MP casting spells on Baramos. The Pilgrim or the Sage
should pay attention to the HP of each member of the party and heal
the wounded.
With the Wizard and the Pilgrim or the Sage as the support group, the
members who excel in fighting (the Hero, the Soldier, etc.) should keep
delivering direct blows. The battle will be a long one, but with good
teamwork, you should prevail...
--------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 66

So you defeated the Archfiend Baramos. The quest was long and at some
points you thought you would never make it to the end. But you have
persevered. It's time to return to Aliahan and tell the world what you
accomplished!
When you arrive at the town of Aliahan, everyone in the town already
seems to know of your feat and they thank you. The King of Aliahan
commends your quest and orders a celebration...but then...an unearthly
voice is heard out of nowhere...

"Ha, ha, ha!"
"I am Zoma, Master Archfiend who rules the dark realms."
"By the powers I possess, before long, this world too will be locked in
darkness..."

The King, depressed with yet another threat from the dark realm,
dismisses you. You are exhausted but decide to continue your quest.
Where do you go from here...and how?
Remembering the Great Pit of Giaga near the castle of Baramos, you
visit it again. There is a hole in the floor now. Being suspicious, you
jump into it and enter.

THE CASTLE TOWN
You must gather information again by TALKing to everyone you see. Be
sure to open locked doors if you see any. You will be surprised by who
you know in this town. He is on the second floor of the building on the
north side of town. He seems reformed now and, in appreciation of the
compassion you once showed him, gives you some information.

                             They Say...
* The Stones of Sunlight are in Tantegal Castle
* When rain and sunlight are combined, a Rainbow Bridge will form.
---------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 68

WHERE ARE THE STONES OF SUNLIGHT?
They don't seem to be in the underground chamber outside the castle as
you may have hoped. Things aren't that simple. Your old acquaintance in
the castle town said "...in Tantegal Castle." Shouldn't you look for it
"inside" the castle instead?

                             They Say...
* The Master Archfiend's castle is across the sea.
* It may be possible to defeat the Master Archfiend, Zoma, if you
  possess at least the Sword of Kings, the Armor of Radiance, and the
  Shield of Heroes.
* The village of Kol is east of Tantegel by boat.
* The Fairy Flute may be in the village of Kol.
* The spirit, Rubiss is sealed in by a curse of the Archfiend.

In this village, you find a couple from Jipang. According to the wife,
they fled Jipang when it looked like they were to become the next
offerings to the Orochi. She also mentions that her husband used to be
a swordsmith in Jipang. He now runs the item store in the town. Do you
think he can help you in some way?

                               They Say...
* Rubiss is sealed inside a Tower on an island to the west.
* The Sphere of light should weaken the magical powers of the
  Archfiend.
* The Sword of Kings was shattered into pieces by the Archfiend.
* The owner of the item store buys useless things, restores them, and
  resells them.
* The owner of the item store is from Jipang and he used to be a
  swordsmith.
* The Sword of Kings was made of Oricon.
* The Fairy Flute should free Rubiss from the curse that turned her
  into a stone statue.

FIND ORICON
There is a man who is also looking for Oricon. He says he heard there
were some in this town. TALK to the two women in the outer eastern
section of the town. One of them says she saw something glittering
in...SEARCH the area.

CHECK OUTSIDE THE SOUTHERN PART OF TOWN
There are a few buildings and a pasture there. Don't overlook them.

                             They Say...
* A flute is buried four steps south of the bath in Kol.
* The Sphere of Light is in the world above.
--------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 71

GO BACK TO THE VILLAGE OF KOL
You now have the Oricon. But what does it do? Well, it is of no use to
you unprocessed. Do you remember the item store owner who used to be a
swordsmith in Jipang. Perhaps he can help you in some way. If you
cannot figure out what to do with the Oricon, see the hint on page 79.
While you are in the village of Kol, don't forget to look for the flute
mentioned by a woman in the town of Hauksness.

GET THE SPHERE OF LIGHT
If you don't have the Sphere of Light yet, go to the world above and
get it. "Where is it?" you ask. Did you notice that there was a castle
on the north bank of the river which led you to the Promontory of
Olivia? If you were careful, you should have caught a glimpse of it.
That is the castle where the Dragon Queen lives. Visit her in her
chamber located in the center of the castle.

                     THE TOWN OF CANTLIN - Level 38

Depressed with the fear of the Master Archfiend, most people here don't
want to work. Except the old man behind the barrier, they don't seem
informative, either. Be sure to TALK to the old man.

                             They Say...
* To go to the island of the Archfiend, you will need the Stones of
  Sunlight, the Staff of Rain, and the Sacred Amulet.

TALK to everyone. Go into every room you can find in the town. An
unlikely person might give you a very crucial hint. However, whether he
is a reliable source is unknown.

                               They Say...
* The Armor of Radiance is in the tower that Rubiss is sealed in.
* When drops of liquid light up the darkness, a rainbow bridge will
  appear at the western end of this island.
* The Sage's Stone heals everyone's wounds and can be used any number
  of times.
* There is a secret passage behind the throne in the castle of the
  Archfiend.

                  THE TOWER WEST OF KOL - Level 40
-------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 74

The old man outside the tower says that if you have the Fairy Flute,
you should go up to the fifth floor. But you cannot go up higher than
the third floor from inside. There is a corridor on the ground floor
which has the first flight of stairs leading to the fifth floor. You
can enter the corridor by jumping off the north opening of the third
floor.

CHECK EVERY TREASURE BOX
Do you remember what you heard about the Armor of Radiance in the town
of Rimuldar? It should be in this tower.

HOW TO WALK ON ROTATING FLOORS
This tower has Rotating Floors, tricky sections of floors new to you.
When your characters are on these floors, their movement and the normal
+Control Pad movements don't correspond. Although it may seem there is
no relationship between the direction you enter by using the +Control
Pad and the actual movement made by your characters on the screen,
there is one simple relationship. Can you find it? If you can't figure
it out, see the hint on page 79.
---------------------------------------------------------------
                              Page 75

FREE THE SPIRIT, RUBISS
The stone statue you see in the middle of the fifth floor is the Spirit
Rubiss. Play (USE) the Fairy Flute to free Rubiss. When freed, she will
give you...

                     THE RAINBOW BRIDGE - Level 43

See the spirit at the underground shrine near the town of Cantlin. She
will give you the Staff of Rain. Now you should have all three
necessary items to get to the island of the Master Archfiend: the
Stones of Sunlight, the Staff of Rain, and the Sacred Amulet.

See the sage at the underground shrine in the island south of Rimuldar.
Satisfied to see you have collected all of the three crucial items, he
will give you the Rainbow Drop.

At the promontory northwest of the town of Rimuldar, use the Rainbow
Drop. The Rainbow Bridge will appear, connecting the island of the
Archfiend and the island of Rimuldar.

                    THE CASTLE OF ZOMA - Level 44

The Master Archfiend, Zoma, is inside this castle. Don't get trapped in
the castle's infinite loops. Can't find the way to Zoma? Do you
remember what the chronic lying prisoner you saw in the town of
Rimunldar had said? Maybe he was telling the truth that time...(If you
can't find the passage, see the hint on page 79.)
--------------------------------------------------------------
                                Page 76

On the fifth basement leve, you will witness a courageous warrior
fighting a monster. He is the person you heard so much about at many of
the places you visited...
----------------------------------------------------------------
                                Page 77

HOW TO FIGHT ZOMA
On the fifth basement level, you will see five treasure chests. One of
them contains the Sage's Stone. This item, when used during a battle,
works like the Healus spell. Have the Pilgrim or Sage member of your
party carry it.
Zoma awaits you on the sixth basement level. He is protected by three
bodyguards. Defeat them, one by one. Before each battle, be sure to
restore the maximum HP of each character. If you have the Wizard's
Ring, USE it to also restore some MP.
As soon as the battle with Zoma begins, USE the Sphere of Light. Being
the Master Archfiend of the Darkness, Zoma is susceptible to the power
omitted by the Sphere of Light. Without it, you cannot inflict any
damage to Zoma.
As always, the Pilgrim or Sage member should concentrate on healing the
wounded. The Wizard should concentrate on doubling the attack power of
each member, by casting the Bikill spell. Don't waste turns or MP by
casting attack spells which don't seem to work on Zoma. From midpoint
of the battle onward, Zoma will breathe out air to nullify the effects
of all magic spells. The Sage's Stone will, then, be indispensable.
Even with an elaborate plan and coordinated teamwork, you will find
Zoma seemingly impossible to defeat. Believe in yourself. You will
win...eventually...if you are determined. GOOD LUCK!

                          THE ULTIMATE HINTS

WHERE IS THE MAGIC BALL?
An old man in the village of Reeve has one. Look for him.

HOW TO OPEN THE SEALED STONE WALL IN THE PYRAMID
On the third floor, on the wall to the south, there are four buttons:
two on the east side and two on the west side. Press one of the two
buttons on the east side first and then one of the other two on the
west side. If you press the right buttons, the wall will open. If not,
you will fall through the trap door!

HOW TO ARRANGE THREE BOULDERS IN THE CASTLE OF EGINBEAR
You can attempt to arrange three boulders as many times as you like. If
you make a mistake, exit the chamber and re-enter the chamber when you
are ready. The screen shots below illustrate one way to move the
boulder on the left to the blue floor:

Push the boulder on the left toward the wall.

Push the boulder in the middle to the right to make some room.

Push the boulder on the left to the right. Be careful not to drop it in
the pond.

Push the boulder on the left to the blue floor. Repeat for the other
boulders.

WHERE IS THE MISSING ALLY?
The character sent away to limbo by the Limbo spell will be returned
to this world unscathed. He/she will be found at Luisa's Place in
Aliahan. See Luisa and ADD the ally back to your party again.

HOW TO ENTER THE CHAMBER OF THE KING OF SAMANAO AT NIGHT
See the illustration of the castle of Samanao in Section II. Notice the
tower on the east side of the castle. Enter the castle through the
kitchen door on the east side. Go up the tower to the top and jump off
through the opening to the west. Walk on the roof to get to the King's
Chamber.

WHERE IS THE SWORD OF GAIA?
If you TALKed to the spirit at the shrine jail by the Promontory of
Olivia, you should know that the Sword of Gaia is hidden around one of
the bodies there. SEARCH the area around the body.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                               Page 79

WHERE ARE THE SIX ORBS?

GREEN ORB  Visit the village of Tedanki at night. Open the Final Key
           Door of a prison cell and TALK to the prisoner there.

PURPLE ORB SEARCH the treasure chest the Orochi in Jipang leaves when
           she is defeated.

RED ORB    Move the boulder outside of the House of Pirates and SEARCH
           the spot. Climb down the stairs.

BLUE ORB   SEARCH a treasure chest on the third basement level of the
           Navel of the Earth.

YELLOW ORB Visit the new town often and TALK to the Merchant. When he
           is imprisoned, he reveals where to look for it.

SILVER ORB See the old man at the shrine by one of the openings of the
           Cave of Necrogond.

HOW TO ENTER BARAMOS' CHAMBER
Follow the route outlined below (the letters correspond to the ones in
the diagram of the castle of Baramos in Section II):

2F: B-A     D-C
    | |     | |
1F: C D-H K-G F-E A-B-Baramos' Chamber
        | |     | |
B1:     D-F     C-A

WHERE IS THE SWORD OF KINGS?
Find the Oricon in the pasture of the town of Hauksness and go to the
village of Kol. Sell the Oricon to the owner of the item store who used
to be a swordsmith in Jipang. Leave the village and come back later. He
will have forged the Sword of Kings and put it up for sale by then.

HOW TO WALK ON THE ROTATING FLOORS
When you are on a rotating floor, pressing the +Control Pad in the
direction corresponding to the dark side of the floor moves you up. For
example, when you  are on one of the floors in the picture to the
right, pressing left on +Control Pad moves you up. Try to figure out
how other moves can be controlled.

HOW TO REACH THE THIRD BASEMENT LEVEL IN THE CASTLE OF ZOMA
To avoid getting trapped in the infinite loop of the second basement,
you must enter the second basement through a secret passage. Do you
remember what the chronic lying prisoner int he town of Rimuldar said?
SEARCH the area behind the throne on the first basement level. You will
find the stairs to the passage.
