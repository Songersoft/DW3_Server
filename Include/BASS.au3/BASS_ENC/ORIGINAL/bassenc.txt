NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will have to copy BASSENC.DLL and
      BASS.DLL into the same directory as them.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the
      same directory as the BASSenc API.

NOTE: To view the documentation, you will need a CHM viewer, such as CHMOX
      which is included in the BASS package.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the
      same directory as the BASSenc API.


What's the point?
=================
BASSenc is an extension that allows BASS channels to be encoded using any
command-line encoder that has STDIN support (LAME/OGGENC/etc), optionally
sending the data to a Shoutcast/Icecast server.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required.

The examples require OGGENC and/or LAME. Both are available from the MO3
webpage at the www.un4seen.com website.


Using BASSenc
=============
Win32 version
-------------
To use BASSenc with Borland C++ Builder, you'll first have to create a
Borland C++ Builder import library for it. This is done by using the
IMPLIB tool that comes with Borland C++ Builder. Simply execute this:

	IMPLIB BASSENCBCB.LIB BASSENC.DLL

... and then use BASSENCBCB.LIB in your projects to import BASSenc.

To use BASSenc with LCC-Win32, you'll first have to create a compatible
import library for it. This is done by using the PEDUMP and BUILDLIB
tools that come with LCC-Win32. Run these 2 commands:

	PEDUMP /EXP BASSENC.LIB > BASSENCLCC.EXP
	BUILDLIB BASSENCLCC.EXP BASSENCLCC.LIB

... and then use BASSENCLCC.LIB in your projects to import BASSenc.

MacOSX version
--------------
A separate "LIB" file is not required for OSX. Using XCode, you can simply
add the DYLIB file to the project. Or using a makefile, you can build your
programs like this, for example:

	gcc yoursource -L. -lbass -lbassenc -o yourprog

As with LIBBASS.DYLIB, the LIBBASSENC.DYLIB file must be put in the same
directory as the executable (it can't just be somewhere in the path). See
the example makefiles.

LIBBASSENC.DYLIB is a universal binary, with support for both PowerPC and
Intel Macs. If you want PowerPC-only or Intel-only versions, the included
makefile can create them for you, by typing "make ppc" or "make i386".

TIP: The BASSENC.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSenc documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.
